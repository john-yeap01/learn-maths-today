## Installation

It is advised to install Manim into a virtual environment such as a conda environment. Follow the instructions from https://www.manim.community (this is the Community version, as Grant's original repo is not designed for public use). Activate the environment and then clone this repo into a location of your choice. 

To run the animations:

Navigate to the proper folder name, eg
`
cd LearnMathsToday/arc_lengths
`
